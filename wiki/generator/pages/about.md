## Bridging Fractals and Thought

### ðŸ’¡ [neurite.network](https://neurite.network/) unleashes a new dimension of digital interface...

### _...the fractal dimension._

> ðŸ§© **Drawing from chaos theory and graph theory, Neurite unveils the hidden patterns and intricate connections that shape creative thinking.**

For over two years we've been iterating out a virtually limitless workspace that blends the mesmerizing complexity of fractals with contemporary mind-mapping technique.

ðŸ“¢ **Major Update:** See [Neurite Desktop](#neurite-desktop)

## `Why Fractals?` 

The Mandelbrot Set is not just an aesthetic choice â€” fractal logic is ingrained into a countless number of natural and constructed phenomena:

- [art](https://www.nature.com/articles/20833)
- [music](https://www.mpg.de/9379548/fractals-set-the-tone)
- [cosmic web](https://cosmicweb.kimalbrecht.com/)

ðŸŒ€ Fractals act as the cross-disciplinary framework for non-integer dimensional thought â€” where conventional notions of 4D spacetime are put into question.

> The goal of this project is to grow agentic graphs of fractal creativity & collaboration.

## `Why Nodes?`

Nodes represent text, images, videos, code, and AI agents. Together, they thread a personalized microcosm of your thoughts and inspirations. ðŸ”­

[neurite.network](https://neurite.network/) connects physics simulation of graphs with an underlying fractal topology to kinematically define interactive, iterative, and modular graphs of ideation.

## `Complexity Inspires Simplicity / Basins Attract`

Whether you're a researcher, writer, artist, developer, educator, or simply a curious thinker, Neurite offers a departure from the conventional interface.

It's an interactive landscape tracing your ever-branching pathways of thought.

Movements through the fractal are no longer interrupted at each step. Instead, the rendering persists and regenerates as you interact.
